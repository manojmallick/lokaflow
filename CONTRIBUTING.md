- Include steps to reproduce, expected behaviour, and actual behaviour
- Include your OS, hardware (CPU/GPU), and model versions

### Suggesting Features

- Open a GitHub Discussion or Issue with the `feature-request` label
- Explain the use case — what problem does this solve?

### Submitting Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

4. Ensure your code follows existing style conventions
5. Add or update tests where applicable
6. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change

### Pull Request Requirements

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- All tests must pass
- No breaking changes without prior discussion

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming, respectful community.

- Be kind and constructive in all interactions
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Disagreements about code are fine — attack the idea, not the person

Violations may result in removal from the project.
